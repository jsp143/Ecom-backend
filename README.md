test-automation-quickstart
Java quickstart project for test automation, covering performance, UI acceptance, API acceptance testing and security testing. Created with lessons learned from a large number of development projects to provide all commonly required components and concepts. The framework was first introduced on the OpenCredo.com Blog.

Concepts Included
Parallel test runs
Shared state across cucumber step definitions
Dependency injection
Page Object pattern
Common web page interaction methods
Common api interaction methods
Mavenised performance tests
Externalised test configuration
Commonly used test utility classes
Simple security tests
Tools
Maven
Cucumber-JVM
JUnit
Spring
Selenium Webdriver
Jackson
JMeter
OWASP Zed Attack Proxy
Requirements
In order to utilise this project you need to have the following installed locally:

Maven 3
Chrome and Chromedriver (UI tests use Chrome by default, can be changed in config)
Java 1.8
ZAP 2.7.0 (Run it in deamon mode using the following command: ./zap.sh -daemon -port 8888 -config api.disablekey=true)
In order for the api tests to pass, you will need to configure your test email. You may need to set up a testing email account (free ones can be made on gmail.com). Then you can either edit it in the API properties file, or supplied as maven parameters. E.g.

mvn install -Papi-acceptance-tests -Dapi.acceptance.test.email.address=MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS -Dapi.acceptance.test.email.password=MY_EMAIL_PASSWORD

Usage
The project is broken into separate modules for API, UI, Performance and Security testing. Each of these modules can be utilised independently of the others using maven profiles.

To run all modules, navigate to test-automation-quickstart directory and run:

mvn clean install

To run UI acceptance tests only, navigate to test-automation-quickstart directory and run:

mvn clean install -Pui-acceptance-tests

To run API acceptance tests only, navigate to test-automation-quickstart directory and run:

mvn clean install -Papi-acceptance-tests

To run performance tests only, navigate to test-automation-quickstart directory and run:

mvn clean install -Pperformance-tests

To run security tests only, navigate to test-automation-quickstart directory and run:

mvn clean install -Psecurity-acceptance-tests

Reporting
Reports for each module are written into their respective /target directories after a successful run.

UI acceptance tests result in a HTML report for each feature in test-automation-quickstart/ui-acceptance-tests/target/cucumber-parallel/. In the case of test failures, a screen-shot of the UI at the point of failure is embedded into the report.

API acceptance tests result in a HTML report for each feature in test-automation-quickstart/api-acceptance-tests/target/cucumber-parallel/.

Performance tests result in a .jtl results file and .png graphs showing response times and transactions per second, generated in test-automation-quickstart/performance-tests/target/jmeter/results.

Security acceptance tests result in a HTML report for each feature in test-automation-quickstart/security-acceptance-tests/target/cucumber-parallel/. They will also generate a security risks HTML report in test-automation-quickstart/security-acceptance-tests/security-reports/security-report.html.

NOTE: As mentioned, cucumber reports are written to a separate file for each feature. This occurs as a result of running tests in parallel, meaning that you do not get a single unified test report. If using CI, these individual reports can be joined using plugins such as the Jenkins Cucumber-JVM-Reports plugin.
